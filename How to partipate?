1. Participating in CampaignsTalent Protocol frequently runs campaigns, such as the "Road to TGE" campaign hosted on platforms like CoinList. These campaigns encourage users to engage with the ecosystem by completing quests, such as creating onchain content, inviting friends, or connecting their wallets to the Talent Passport app. For example, the "Road to TGE" campaign allocated 5,000,000 TAL tokens (0.5% of the total supply) to participants, with rewards distributed based on a public leaderboard tracking XP (experience points) earned through activities. Additionally, SYND rewards can be integrated into such campaigns, allowing users to earn both TAL and SYND tokens by directing their staked SYND toward Talent Protocol’s appchain.

2. Staking SYND for RewardsUsers holding SYND tokens can stake them on the Commons Chain, Syndicate’s staking infrastructure, to support registered appchains like Talent Protocol. Stakers direct their tokens toward specific appchains for an entire epoch, earning rewards from:Base Pool: Rewards based on stake size and duration.
Performance Pool: Rewards tied to the performance of the appchain, such as user activity or transaction volume.
Appchain Pool: Rewards allocated to appchains based on their ecosystem contributions.

By staking SYND toward Talent Protocol’s appchain, users contribute to the platform’s growth while earning a share of the epoch’s emissions. These rewards are claimable at the end of each epoch, with no vesting period or lock-up conditions, ensuring flexibility for participants.

3. Boosting Creator ScoreTalent Protocol’s Creator Score is a hybrid metric that measures a user’s influence and activity within the Web3 ecosystem. By creating onchain content on platforms like Zora, Farcaster, or Noice, users can boost their Creator Score, which unlocks additional rewards, including SYND tokens. The more active a user is—through content creation, app engagement, or community participation—the higher their score and potential earnings.

For instance, creating a post on Farcaster or minting an NFT on Zora can contribute to a user’s Creator Score, which may qualify them for SYND rewards if Talent Protocol’s appchain is part of a staking campaign. This incentivizes creators to produce high-quality, onchain content that strengthens the ecosystem.4. Mystery Boxes and GiveawaysTo keep the community engaged, Talent Protocol incorporates gamified elements like Mystery Boxes and weekly giveaways. During campaigns, participants can open Mystery Boxes to win up to 500 TAL tokens or, in some cases, SYND rewards. These giveaways add an element of excitement and ensure that even users outside the top leaderboard ranks have a chance to earn.
