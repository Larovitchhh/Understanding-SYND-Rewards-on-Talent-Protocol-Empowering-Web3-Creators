Talent Protocol is a decentralized platform designed to empower Web3 builders, creators, and professionals by giving them tools to showcase their skills, build reputations, and connect with opportunities. It serves as a "resume for the new era of the internet," enabling users to create a Talent Passport—a digital identity that aggregates onchain and offchain contributions to reflect their expertise and influence.

At the heart of Talent Protocol’s ecosystem is the TALENT token, which powers transactions, governance, and rewards. The platform also collaborates with other protocols, such as Syndicate, to enhance its reward mechanisms, making it a hub for Web3 talent looking to monetize their efforts.
