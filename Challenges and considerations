While SYND rewards offer exciting opportunities, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:Volatility: Like all cryptocurrencies, SYND and TAL tokens are subject to market fluctuations, which can affect their value. Users should be aware of the risks associated with crypto investments.

Technical Barriers: Staking SYND and navigating Web3 platforms may require some technical knowledge. Talent Protocol mitigates this by designing intuitive campaigns, but newcomers may need to familiarize themselves with wallets and blockchain basics.

Epoch Timing: SYND rewards are tied to 30-day epochs, so users must plan their staking strategy to align with these periods. Unstaking requests take effect only at the end of an epoch, which may limit liquidity.
