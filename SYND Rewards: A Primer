SYND is the native token of the Syndicate protocol, a decentralized platform that enables community-driven investment and appchain ecosystems. Through its staking and emissions system, SYND incentivizes token holders to support appchains (application-specific blockchains) while earning rewards. The staking system operates on 30-day epochs, distributing 80 million SYND tokens over approximately four years across three pools: Base Pool, Performance Pool, and Appchain Pool.

Talent Protocol integrates SYND rewards to incentivize its community to engage in meaningful activities, such as creating onchain content, participating in campaigns, and building reputation within the Web3 ecosystem. By aligning with Syndicateâ€™s staking model, Talent Protocol offers a dynamic rewards system that ties directly to user contributions.
